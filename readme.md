Joey Melnick - NYT App

In terminal direct to the root folder (nty-app).
Use command npm run start
Server is run on port 8080 (http://localhost:8080/)


** I left most of this app with pretty basic styling and design.

There also were a few hiccups that I ran into with the NYT API.
They didn't seem to have a section for politics or NyRegion on the search via date
So I used the top stories for those sections.
Also the NYT blocks using Iframes of their content so I simply did an external link.

I didn't optimize for responsiveness either because of timing. **
